Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Charlie Chapman and I'm working on a new podcast called Launched where I'll interview app developers and other creators about their experiences releasing a creation out into the world.

I recently went through this process myself with the launch of my iOS app [Dark Noise](https://darknoise.app/) and I found that listening to developer interviews on podcasts was extremely helpful in preparing me for what to expect and giving me ideas on how to build a marketing plan around the release.  My hope is that **Launched** can be a resource for aspiring creators by providing a platform for people to share their experiences launching something into the world.

This is where I need your help. If you are an app developer or creator who has a launch story to tell (or a future launch coming up) I'd love to hear from you!  I've created a form to collect applications for coming on the show [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxduoOnjnF_qE6PpnEGdKewWHvB3YDl0gv3WAxAJ4HDVq8Bg/viewform).

If this podcast sounds interesting to you, give us a follow on Twitter at [@LaunchedFM](https://twitter.com/launchedfm) or my personal account at [@chuckyc17](https://twitter.com/chuckyc17).  And if you have any ideas or feedback, my DMs are always open!
