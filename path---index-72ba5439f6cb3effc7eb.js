My hope is that <strong>Launched</strong> can be a resource for aspiring creators by providing a platform for people to share their experiences launching something into the world.</p>\n<p>This is where I need your help. If you are an app developer or creator who has a launch story to tell (or a future launch coming up) I\'d love to hear from you!  I\'ve created a form to collect applications for coming on the show <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxduoOnjnF_qE6PpnEGdKewWHvB3YDl0gv3WAxAJ4HDVq8Bg/viewform">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If this podcast sounds interesting to you, give us a follow on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/launchedfm">@LaunchedFM</a> or my personal account at <a href="https://twitter.com/chuckyc17">@chuckyc17</a>.
